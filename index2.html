					<h1>1998</h1>
					<p>The Original Rolling Store</p>
					<p>The popularity of lyne's baked cupcakes in the park gave her an idea for a “Rolling Food Store. “Much like the food trucks of today, they converted an old Ford car into a mobile canteen. The rolling food store would go around Luneta Park and the nearby areas serving the same food her family would eat during their picnics. By force of circumstance, the rolling store moved from Luneta to Dewey Blvd, now known as Roxas Blvd. Alex & Asiang decided to put up a restaurant in that same spot where it still stands today.</p>

					<h1>2000</h1>
					<p>The Chicken Barbeque</p>
					<p>The Rlyniah survived wartime through lyne’s resourcefulness and food innovations. All these made Rlyniah the place to be, and soon there were new ventures including a branch in Cubao and Ermita and a beach resort in Las Piñas. But the beach resort posed a new kind of problem for Asiang: her cutlery rarely found their way back to her kitchen since diners would bring them to their beach huts. As a solution, she began to serve food barbecue-style, lessening the use of utensils. This small problem-solving experiment paved the way for one of Rlyniah’s beloved bestsellers - Chicken Barbecue, which is now paired with java rice and java sauce.</p>

					<h1>2013</h1>
					<p>Mother of Filipino Cooking</p>
					<p>lola Lyne was recognized as the Mother of Filipino Cooking. Whenever lola Lyne cooked for her customers, she put in the same love and care as though she were cooking for her own children. She believed that no matter the size of your budget, you can eat like a grandee. That’s how Rlyniah has come to be for Filipinos - a welcoming home where hearty appetites and modest wallets are rewarded with quality food and good old feeling of family.</p>

					<h1>2018</h1>
					<p>An Icon in Cultural History</p>
					<p>It is no easy feat to survive 50 years in the food industry. The success of Rlyniah is attributed to the clear and simple vision of Asiang to serve quality Filipino comfort food. In recognition of the Rlyniah’s contribution to Philippine culture, a historical marker was installed on July 4, 2013 by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP).</p>
